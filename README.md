# Sorting-Algorithms
## How did I split the image?
For split in columns I taked the pixel array of the image and divide it on columns of 1px by 400px, and for each column I gave a value or weight that helped to sort the matrix(vector) of values. After I asigned a pygame.Rect object with their coordenates (x,y) for each column slice to be able to draw them.
